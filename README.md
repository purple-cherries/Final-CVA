# Final-CVA

You're a journalist, reporting a new-found vaccination againt Covid_19 when a accidental yet mass leak of contaminated virus wrecks havoc.
You are the only one safe because you managed to reach a safe covid-free bay at the time. 
You find a sample of the immediate antidote for coronavirus and now must safely get to the VaccineCenter, gather  barrels, and collect as much  vaccines  as possible and get it to the mayorâ€™s office ASAP. 
During this one-of-a-kind mission, you will encounter several germs trying to attack you, or obstacles in your way. The health of the nation is in your hands. Good Luck...
